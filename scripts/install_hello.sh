#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Installs a trivial `hello` command into the workspace's persistent bin dir
# (~/.aw-workspace/bin, on PATH, survives restarts). Idempotent — safe to
# re-run (on install, and on every reconcile pass after workspace
# recreation). The greeting word is configurable via AW_APP_HELLO_GREETING
# (set by template_app/plugin.py from config_schema.greeting — config_visible:
# false in aw-app.json keeps it off the Settings UI, but it's still real,
# ctx.config-driven config).
#
# TEMPLATE: replace this with your app's real installer(s). Keep the shape —
# idempotent, no interactive prompts, writes only under AW_WORKSPACE_HOME —
# see aw-app-essentials/scripts/install_*.sh for real examples (apt package,
# single-binary download, corepack activation, git-clone install).
