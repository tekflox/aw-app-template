"""Regression tests for the executable logic embedded in
``.github/workflows/code-review.yml``.

**Why this file exists.** That workflow carries a real two-round state
machine — label-driven round detection, round-1 vs round-2 merge
eligibility, the `blocks_merge`-missing fail-closed rule, the draft-merge
guard — which is meaningfully more logic than workflow YAML usually holds,
and which CI could not otherwise exercise at all. It was flagged twice by
the Dev Team reviewer (once on the predecessor PR for this file, again on
PR #13) as shipping with no committed regression guard: a future edit could
flip `eligible = not blocking` to the wrong boolean and nothing would fail
until a real PR misbehaved. Fixing it the second time rather than filing the
same note a third time.

**How it works.** The step scripts are EXTRACTED from the workflow file by
text-scanning its heredoc markers and then executed directly, so these tests
assert against the bytes CI actually runs. They cannot drift from the
workflow the way a hand-maintained copy of the logic would — if someone
renames a step or changes a marker, extraction fails loudly rather than
silently testing nothing.

Deliberately NOT parsed with PyYAML: the CI job installs an explicit, short
dependency list, and adding a parser dependency to run a text scan would be
the kind of incidental coupling that makes a test the first thing someone
deletes. Nothing here imports `template_app`, so none of it affects the
100% coverage gate (``[tool.coverage.run] source = ["template_app"]``).
